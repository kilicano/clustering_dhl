# Network Optimization Project  
**EBS2003 – Second-year Project II (2018/2019)**

This repository contains the implementation and analysis developed for **Second-year Project II** in the **Econometrics and Operations Research** programme.

The project combines **algorithmic modelling**, **network structures**, and **quantitative analysis** to solve a complex, data-driven case study and translate results into **managerial insights**.

## Project Scope

The assignment required answering **six analytical questions** based on a real-world inspired case, supported by:

- Formal mathematical / algorithmic approaches  
- Java-based implementations  
- Quantitative results (tables and figures)  
- A concise business-oriented summary for non-technical stakeholders  

The project concluded with a **graded 15-minute presentation** of methods and findings.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Network modelling using nodes and edges  
- Algorithmic problem solving in Java  
- Object-oriented design for scalable models  
- Separation of data, model, and solver logic  
- Translating quantitative results into managerial conclusions  
- Team-based development under time and quality constraints  

## Project Structure

- `Network` – core network representation  
- `Nodes` – abstraction of network nodes  
- `Edges` – abstraction of directed/undirected edges  
- `Solver` – algorithms operating on the network  

The structure reflects a modular design to support analysis, experimentation, and clarity.

## Deliverables (Original Course Requirements)

- **Analytical report** (≤ 20 pages)  
  - Introduction to the case  
  - Answers to Questions 1–6  
  - Explanation of methods, formulas, and algorithms  
  - Numerical results with tables and charts  

- **Business summary** (2 pages)  
  - Non-technical synthesis of results  
  - Managerial implications and conclusions  

- **Final presentation** (15 minutes)  
  - Evaluation based on clarity, creativity, and persuasiveness  

## Context

This project was completed in **Year 2**, building on first-year programming foundations and moving toward **structured modelling, abstraction, and applied optimization**.

The code and structure are intentionally preserved to reflect my development at this stage rather than retrofitted with later improvements.

## How to Run

Compile and execute using standard Java tooling:

```bash
javac *.java
java Solver
